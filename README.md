This is the repository for my contributions to the C# Live Project from the Tech Academy.

I was tasked to perform two tasks:

- Create CRUD functionality for an ASP.NET MVC application utilizing Entity Framework regarding a rental item documentation interface for staff that don't have any technical knowledge. Tasks included:

 - Create a Donation page in order to log in donation information (Click on "Click to Support" in order to view Donation Page.)
 - Creating "Create", "Delete", "Details", "Edit", and "Index" pages,
 - Creating "Sort By:" functionality utilizing partial views in order to display the needed information to the user, such as "No Extra Sorting", "Damaged Rentals", "Undamaged Rentals", "Rentals A-Z", and "Rentals Z-A",
 - Stylizing the website to match with the customer's wanted aesthetic, making use of Bootstrap 4 in order to maintain a seamless look throughout the rest of the website and to customer preferences
 - Click on "Rental" at the Nav Bar at the top, click on "Rental Histories" in order to view . 

Languages utilized for this project include HTML, JS, CSS, AJAX, and SQL.
